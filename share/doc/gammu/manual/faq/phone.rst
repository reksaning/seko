.. _faq-phones:

Is my phone supported?
----------------------

Generally any phone capable of AT commands or IrMC should be supported. Also
any Nokia phone using Nokia OS should work. For Symbian please check separate
topic. You can check other user experiences in `Gammu Phones Database`_.

For information how to configure your phone, see :ref:`faq-config`.

Which phone is best supported?
------------------------------

It really depends on what you expect. If you want to use SMSD, this topic is covered
in separate FAQ (see :ref:`faq-smsd-phone`). For backing up your contacts or calendar,
most of Nokia (S40 or S60) phones should work as well as any other capable of AT 
commands. Gammu also supports wide range of extensions for Samsung, Motorola, Siemens
or Sony-Ericsson phones.

.. _faq-nokia:

Are Nokia phones supported?
---------------------------

It depends on used operating systems Series40 and older phones should work 
(see :ref:`faq-config-nokia` for information how to configure them), Symbian 
based phones are covered in separate topic, check :ref:`faq-symbian`.

.. _faq-symbian:

Are Symbian phones supported?
-----------------------------

You need to install applet to the phone to allow Gammu talk to it. For older
phones (Symbian 9.0 and older), install gnapplet (see :ref:`gnapplet`). Newer
phones can use Python based applet called Series60-remote (see :ref:`s60`).
This option is supported since Gammu 1.29.90.
